# dummy-data-magical-adventure
## Description:
This Java program parses data from a CSV file and performs calculations based on that data. The file contains a list of retail transactions, to include the date, product type, quantity sold, and sale price.
## Features:
The program returns the total revenue based on all transactions listed, as well as the most popular product sold, and the average sale price of each of the product types.
## Purpose:
This is a fun little challenge for myself in utilizing ChatGPT to aid in development. I wanted some practice parsing text data and writing methods to analyze the same, so I had ChatGPT provide the dummy data and propose the questions to be answered by the methods I would then write.
